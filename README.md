A touch sensitive nightlight using addressable LEDs running on a Raspberry Pi Pico. This repo contains both the hardware and the software for the project. Construction uses PCBs for both the inner structure and the diffusers. Some small gaps in the enclosure are expected but the build looks good at a distance. This was made to be built by hand and efforts were made to reduce component count and to require only a soldering iron and hand tools to build.

Errata:

Touch sensors can occasionally miss-trigger and may behave differently depending on what they are plugged into.

All four sides are currently the same. This currently only affects one pattern and is not very noticeable there.

The fade out isn’t as gradual as it could be.

The FR4’s manufactures’ mark will probably be visible.

Corners are dim. This could be fixed by changing the silkscreen on the face and back.

Construction:
Populated boards are wired together and assembled into a cube using taped cubes or ‘six sided nuts’ and standoffs. The back board will chain to the top. Use plastic standoffs thought except where connections to the touch sensors need to be made on the top, left, and right sides. You may need plastic washers to prevent the threaded parts of the standoffs from colliding in the nuts. In each of these locations you will use one brass standoff to make the connection to the touch sensors.
